roboshop deployment using shell

Requirements:

1. check user is having root permissions or not
2. If YES allow further to run commands, If NO exit and provide error message to the user
3. Add colors for logs for better readability
4. Capture logs in log file along with terminal
5. Handle errors/failure cases explicitly
6. Validate the commands running status
7. Optimise the code and keep the code DRY max possible
8. Scripts should not fail when running repeatedly, we need idempotent behaviour.
